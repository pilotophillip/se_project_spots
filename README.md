# Project 3: Spots

## Description
Spots is a responsive photo-sharing webpage built from a Figma design. The goal of this project was to practice real-world front-end workflows — translating a mockup into code, building adaptive layouts, and keeping styling consistent across screen sizes.

## Overview

### Intro
Spots focuses on clean layout structure and responsiveness. I recreated the page from the provided Figma design, ensuring all elements — text, images, and the card grid — adapt smoothly to different device widths.  
The main goal was gaining experience working directly from a design file while maintaining accuracy and accessibility.

### Figma
Design file used for the project:

### Images
All images were exported directly from Figma.  
Before adding them to the project, I optimized them using TinyPNG to improve page load performance:
